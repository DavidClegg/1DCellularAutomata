# 1DCellularAutomata
 A 1D cellular automata

---

This is based on talk I watched last year by Stephen Wolfram. The principle is that you take a single line (an array of bits) as input and then produce a new array based on some rules. When this is repeated enough times it can produce interesting, and often seemingly chaotic, patterns.
